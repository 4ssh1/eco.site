# My Ecommerce Project(Frontend)
I used a tutorial on youtube to get the design of the website, the link to it, is: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9bD98LkBR7O4_SVeN8IXLQRjrGontmbT

Though it was a great help to me, I didnt copy the exact code used, it was more like an aid to build this website.
I also added some features that I liked in the cart page.
